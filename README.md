## Installation

You can have the tinyApps too!

## OneSpotApp

Essentially, a program which stores the location of the programs and runs them all at one click, the program also has a save.txt which ensures that you have the apps saved and don't need to configure them everytime you start the computer.
'save.txt' contains the paths to the files.
The app has been derived from an online tutorial, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE-SpRI3K5g">Building a Python GUI</a>.

## OneSpotTabs

A program that allows you to store urls to your favourite sites, launch all of them, at a click of a button, instead of wasting your time on manually opening them yourself.
Using pickle module as a save file for your urls.

## YTsearch

A program that acts as a simple search through Youtube, opens up a webpage in the browser, if not already open, and gives you the search results.
