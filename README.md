# tinyApps
A collection of small python applications which I have been working on.
---
## OneSpotApp

Essentially, a program which stores the location of the programs and runs them all at one click, the program also has a save.txt which ensures that you have the apps saved and don't need to configure them everytime you start the computer.
'save.txt' contains the paths to the files.
The app has been derived from an online tutorial, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE-SpRI3K5g">Building a Python GUI</a>.
