# tinyApps
A collection of small python applications which I have been working on.

## OneSpotApp
Essentially, a program which stores the location of the programs and runs them all at one click, the program also has a save.txt which ensures that you have the apps saved and don't need to configure them everytime you start the computer.
'save.txt' contains the paths to the files.
